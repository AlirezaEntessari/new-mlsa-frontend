              When the conflict has been addressed, and it's time to move on to
              the "rating adjustment or feedback response" stage, the focus
              shifts to managing the public perception of the resolution and
              improving your reputation. Whether the rating or feedback gets
              adjusted or not, how you handle this stage can leave a lasting
              impression. Here's how to approach it professionally and
              effectively.
